Feature: Restart WhenBroadcastReceived script

  A WhenBroadcastReceived script should be restarted when the message is broadcast again while the script is still running.

  Background:
    Given I have a Program
    And this program has an Object 'test object'

  Scenario: A program with two start scripts and one WhenBroadcastReceived script
    Given 'test object' has a Start script
    And this script has a Broadcast 'Print a, then b after 0.3 seconds' brick
    Given 'test object' has a Start script
    And this script has a Wait 200 milliseconds brick
    And this script has a Broadcast 'Print a, then b after 0.3 seconds' brick
    Given 'test object' has a WhenBroadcastReceived 'Print a, then b after 0.3 seconds' script
    And this script has a Print brick with 'a'
    And this script has a Wait 300 milliseconds brick
    And this script has a Print brick with 'b'
    When I start the program
    And I wait until the program has stopped
    Then I should see the printed output 'aab'

  Scenario: A WhenBroadcastReceived script is restarted when the message it reacts to is sent from within the script
    Given 'test object' has a Start script
    And this script has a Broadcast 'print a immediately and send broadcast message again' brick
    Given 'test object' has a WhenBroadcastReceived 'print a immediately and send broadcast message again' script
    And this script has a Print brick with 'a'
    And this script has a Broadcast 'print a immediately and send broadcast message again' brick
    When I start the program
    And I wait for at least 1000 milliseconds
    Then I should see at least 'aaaaaaaaaa'
